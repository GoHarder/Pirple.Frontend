      <h1>Classic Lo Mein Noodles</h1>
      <p>Lo Mein is a fantastic Chinese takeout option if you’re looking for something a bit thicker than the traditional Chow Mein.</p>
      <p>As a kid growing up my mom was not very well versed in making Chinese food (she once made chow mein with angel hair noodles). I wanted to know how to make lo mein like in Chinese restaurants but despite her best efforts we’d end up with were soy sauce flavored noodles with all the veggies she thought she could hide in the pot.</p>

         <li>Stir in the noodles and bok choy and cook until the bok choy starts to soften and turn bright green, about 1 minute &#x1F423</li>
         <li>Stir in the sauce; allow the sauce to coat all the ingredients and start to simmer about 1 more minute. &#x1F424</li>
         <li>Cook until the chicken is cooked through (about 1 more minute) and sauce starts to bubble into a glaze. Top with scallions and serve hot. &#x1F357</li>
